Quick facts about the R programming language, for people who already know other languages. I started learning R because the Google
Data Analyst Certification course uses it. But all the R courses found were also teaching how to program. So I took a day to
research the question of "what kind of language is R?", so I could stop wondering about these things while doing the lessons.
