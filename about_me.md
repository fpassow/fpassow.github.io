# About Me

I currently work for a Global SMS aggregator, a company that handles text messaging for other companies. When you get a one-time-pin,
delivery notification, or appointment reminder, it passed through my employer or one of a small number of similar companies on its way
to your mobile phone operator. That's a lot of messages. So that's a lot of data.

Troubleshooting often involves filtering, aggregating, and visualizing all that data. Is a problem associated with Verizon, or AT&T?
Is it affecting just one customer or all of them? What error code has become more common? The first step is often to take whatever
a customer reports, and then discover the real scope or nature of the problem.

A good support engineer also communicates across many roles. Like a data analyst, a support engineer works with customers, managers,
end-users, and the owners of all kinds of technological systems.

I use internal tools, a drag-and-drop graphing tool called Pivot (a front end for Druid database), Excel, some SQL, and sometimes Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

I became interested in data work as an area that uses Python. And playing with the Titanic dataset was a lot of fun.
