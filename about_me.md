# About Me

Senior Support Engineer. Senior means can ask about things I don't know. And I go find the answers.

Support has to deliver an answer. A customer opens a case, and it says open until they say their problem is solved.

I currnently work for a Global SMS agregator. A company which handles text messaging for other companies. When you get a one-time-pin,
delivery notificatin, or appointment reminder, it passed throught my employer or one of a small number of similar companies on its way
to your mobile phone operator. That's a lot of messages. And every message is data So that's a lot of data.

Troubleshooting often involves filtering, agregating, and visualizing all that data. Is a problem associated with Verizon, or AT&T?
Is it affecting just one customer or all of them. What error code has become more common. The first step is often to take whatever
a customer reports, and then discover the real scope or nature of the problem.

A good support engineer also communicates across many roles. Like a data analyst, a support engineer works with customers, managers,
end users, ad the owners of all kinds of technologial systems.

Pivot, Excel, some SQL, Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Realized that "data" was a hot area which uses Python. And playing with the Titanic dataset was a lot of fun.
