     <h1>Bootstrap for Engineers</h1>
     
     <p>I once sang the praises of &quot;Cro-Magnon HTML&quot;, ancient, unstyled html which loaded quickly, communicated clearly,
     displayed correctly on every imaginable device, and never broke. It was functional. It did the job. I might have even used the word
     &quot;cosmetic&quot; in a disparaging way.</p>
     
     <p>But to the the modern eye, unstyled HTML does look like poo-with-serifs. It isn&apos;t a nice thing to do to inocent readers.
     And, let&apos;s admit it, we really do like it when our pages look better.</p>
     
     <h2>The Least We Can Do</h2>
     
     <p>First, we will cover adding the bootstrap css to a page, and discuss what that gives us for free. After that, I will list some
     features that might already be on your page, and some quick ways to improve them.</p>
     
     <p>Here's a template for an HTML5 page that pulls bootstrap from a public Content Delivery Network, and adds one META tag and one DIV
     to make it all work.</p>
     
     <pre><code>
<!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&lquot;container&quot;&gt;
    
    
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
     </code></pre>
   
   </div>
  <body>
</html>
