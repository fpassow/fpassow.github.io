     <h1>Bootstrap for Engineers</h1>
     
     <p>I once sang the praises of &quot;Cro-Magnon HTML&quot;, ancient, unstyled html which loaded quickly, communicated clearly,
     displayed correctly on every imaginable device, and never broke. It was functional. It did the job. I might have even used the word
     &quot;cosmetic&quot; in a disparaging way.</p>
     
     <p>But to the the modern eye, unstyled HTML does look like poo-with-serifs. It isn&apos;t a nice thing to do to inocent readers.
     And, let&apos;s admit it, we really do like it when our pages look better.</p>
     
     <h2>Easy Wins</h2>
     
     <p>There are plenty of bootstrap tutorials out there. And they are great for learning Bootstrap end-to-end. On this page, I will
       concentrate on easy ways to apply it to an existing page to make the most difference with the least effort.</p>
     
     <p>First, here's a template for an HTML5 page that pulls bootstrap from a public Content Delivery Network, and adds one META tag and one DIV
     to make it all work.</p>
     
     <p>This gives a number of improvements, including nicer fonts, automatic styling of &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;blockquote&gt; tags, and nice
       styling if you use a &lt;footer&gt; tag in your blockquote.</p>

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
     </pre>
     
     <p>This page uses Bootstrap&apos;s default fonts. The code above is in plain old &lt;pre&gt; tags. And here's an example of 
       a blockquote with a &lt;footer&gt; element inside:</p>
     
     <blockquote>
       A blockquoted quote about blockquote: The HTML <blockquote> Element (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.
       <footer>MDN</footer>
     </blockquote>

  <body>
