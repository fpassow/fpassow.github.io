     <h1>Bootstrap for Engineers</h1>
     
     <p>I once sang the praises of &quot;cromagnon HTML&quot;, ancient, unstyled html which loaded quickly, communicated clearly,
     displayed correctly on every imaginable device, and never broke. It was functional. It did the job. I might have even used the word
     &quot;cosmetic&quot; in a disparaging way.</p>
     
     <p>But the the modern eye, unstyled HTML does look like poo with serifs. It isn&apos;t a nice thing to do to inocent readers.
     And, let&apos;s admit it, we really do like it when our pages look better.</p>
     
     <h2>The Least I Can Do</h2>
     
     <p>First, we will cover adding the bootstrap css to a page, and discuss what that gives us for free. After that, I will list some
     features that might already be on your page, and some quick ways to improve them.</p>
     
     <p>Here's a template for an HTML5 page that pulls bootstrap from a public Content Delivery Network, and adds one META tag and one DIV
     to make it all work.</p>
